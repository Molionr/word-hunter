## How to use

There are three types of words on the web page, **unknown**, **known**, and **known a litte**,
"unknown" and "known a litte" will be highlighted.

<pre>
   ┌────────► known a little ──────┐
   │                               │
   │                               ▼
unknown ────────────────────────► known
</pre>

At first, all the words on the web page are "unknown" by default. You can hover over the words and mark them as "known", and the words will no longer be highlighted.
